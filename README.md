<h1>Face-Recognization</h1>
<p>
Face recognition in Python using OpenCV involves utilizing the OpenCV library to perform facial detection and recognition tasks. Here's a brief description:

OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python, enables face recognition by offering pre-trained deep learning models like Haar cascades or deep neural networks for detecting faces within images or video streams. By utilizing OpenCV's functions and methods, developers can locate and extract facial regions, recognize individuals by comparing facial features, and even perform real-time face tracking. With the integration of OpenCV's features, facial recognition applications can be built for a wide range of purposes, including security, attendance systems, and personalized user experiences.
